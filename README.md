# Natural Selection v3.3

An updated build of the game [Natural Selection] for Windows and Linux focused on quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes.

## Downloads

The **[Natural Selection Launcher](https://github.com/ENSL/NaturalLauncher/releases/)** (Windows) can install, update, or repair the game.

**[Manual installation](https://github.com/ENSL/NS/releases)** (Windows / Linux)

As the game is a Half-Life mod, Steam and Half-Life installations are required to play the game. After installing, restart steam.

A fresh install of NS comes with updated config files containing everything you need to get playing on the standard settings most players prefer. Customization options are built into the advanced options menu, like the Nine Legends competitive UI option. For further customization, team and weapon specific config files are also now available.

## Game not working? Troubleshooting tips

If the game doesn't load, check the following:
1. Restart steam after installation to be able to play the game.
1. If you recieve a "could not load library" error for the client.dll, please install the **[latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)**.
1. Make sure you have verified Half-Life's integrity. Click [here](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=2037-QEUH-3335) for detailed instructions.
1. Check if Half-Life works for you.
1. Make sure you have a clean install. Go to the half-life directory (eg. `c:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Half-Life`) and remove or rename the ``ns`` folder, then try installing NS.
1. Make sure you don't have any additional command line options for NS.
1. For more help, ask on #help in [the community discord](https://discord.gg/ZUSSBUA)

For Linux:
- You may need to remove or rename the `libstdc++so.6` and possibly the `libgcc.so.1` in the `Half-Life` directory so the linux distro's can be used instead. The one steam provides is outdated.
- 32 bit C libraries might need to be installed. Try `apt-get install libc6-i386` if on debian or ubuntu. The `libm.so.6` from it may need to be placed in your half-life folder if you cannot install that package.

## Changes

Update highlights:

- Many new audio and visual options, including the "gamma ramp" restored as a post-processing shader
- Integrated bot players
- Widescreen support
- AI upscaled model textures can be turned on with the "Use High Definition models" HL video option 
- Many FPS-dependent bugs fixed, including jetpack acceleration, so the game can now be fairly played at 200+ FPS
- Quake-style queued jumping to make bunnyhopping more accessible (server adjustable via sv_jumpmode)
- The shotgun and grenade launcher have been reworked to fix reload bugs and animate better
- The "pistol script" is now a standard feature as a toggleable binary trigger
- Weapon reloads are now predicted on the client
- Player names are now shown on the minimap
- The marine HUD now tracks research progress and the alien HUD tracks hive growth
- Teammate health or armor status rings are now shown to players that can heal or repair them
- New minimal and Nine Legends HUDs are available
- A New crosshair system (Modified from [OpenAG](https://github.com/YaLTeR/OpenAG))
- Raw input and sensitivity scaling options are now available and non-accelerated mouse input is now default
- The many other improvements, customization options, and bug fixes can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/ENSL/NS/releases)

## Hosting a server

How to set up a dedicated [Natural Selection] server with [HLDS]:

1. Follow these steps to get steamCMD installed and HLDS updated in it: https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD
1. Set the HLDS install directory after opening steamcmd and before logging in. The following steps assume a directory named `hlds` from doing `force_install_dir ./hlds/`
1. You'll want to run `app_update 90 validate` multiple times in steamCMD to install HLDS and fully update it, as it won't completely do it the first time.
1. Copy the `ns` directory into the `hlds` directory after installing HLDS from steamcmd
1. For Linux servers:
   - Remove or rename the `libstdc++so.6` in the `hlds` directory so the linux distro's can be used instead. The one steam provides is outdated. You may need to rename the `libgcc.so.1` file in the same directory as well.
   - 32 bit C libraries might need to be installed. Try `apt-get install libc6-i386` if on debian or ubuntu. The libm.so.6 from it may need to be placed in your HLDS folder if you cannot install that package.
1. Run the game:
   - Linux:
      ```sh
      ./hlds_run -game ns +map ns_eclipse +sv_secure 1 +port 27015 +hostname "Natural Selection" +maxplayers 32
      ```
   - Windows:
      ```cmd
     hlds.exe -console -game ns +map ns_eclipse +sv_secure 1 +port 27015 +hostname "Natural Selection" +maxplayers 32
      ```

If you are behind a NAT(Router) make sure to open at least those ports: 
- 27015 UDP (game transmission, pings) 
- 26900 UDP (VAC service) -- automatically increments if used in case of additional server processes

For more information see the [HLDS valve wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Half-Life_Dedicated_Server).

In order to check if your server is connected to the steam servers copy the following url in your browser and replace `<your IP address>` with your external ip:
`http://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/GetServersAtAddress/v0001?addr=<your IP address>&format=json`

There is an updated version of metamod called [metamod-p](https://github.com/APGRoboCop/metamod-p/).

To run NS plugins, please use the [updated build of AMX](https://github.com/pierow/amxmodx-ns/releases) that supports this version of NS.

## Bots
Evobot is integrated in NS 3.3 and can be configured in the listen server creation UI or via the following commands in the `server.cfg` for dedicated servers:
```
mp_botsenabled (0/1)        Bots are enabled Y/N
mp_botautomode (0-2)        (0 = manually add/remove bots, 1 = Maintain min player counts, 2 = Keep teams balanced only)
mp_botskill (0-3)        Bot skill (0 = Easiest, 3 = Hardest)
mp_botcommandermode (0-2)    (0 = Bot never commands, 1 = Bot commands after mp_botcommanderwait seconds if nobody else does, 2 = Bot only commands if no humans are on the team)
mp_botcommanderwait (0..)    How long the bot should wait before taking command (if allowed to)
mp_botusemapdefaults (0/1)    Use the map min player counts defined in nsbots.ini Y/N
mp_botminplayers (0-32)        If not using map defaults, maintain this player population for all maps
mp_botallowlerk (0/1)        Bot is allowed to evolve lerk Y/N
mp_botallowfade    (0/1)        Bot is allowed to evolve fade Y/N
mp_botallowonos    (0/1)        Bot is allowed to evolve onos Y/N
mp_botlerkcooldown (0..)    After a lerk is killed, how long in seconds should the bot wait to evolve again (default 60s)
mp_botmaxstucktime (0..)    If a bot is stuck longer than this time (in seconds) it will suicide (default 15s)
mp_botdebugmode (0-2)        (0 = Disabled, 1 = Drone Mode, 2 = Test Nav Mode). Use test nav mode to validate your nav files.

sv_botadd <Team>    If mp_botautomode is 0, this will manually add a bot to team 1 or 2. If Team is 0, it will assign randomly
sv_botremove <Team>    If mp_botautomode is 0, this will manually remove a bot from team 1 or 2. If Team is 0, it will remove randomly
sv_botregenini        If your copy of nsbots.ini is lost or corrupted, this will generate a fresh one

bot_cometome        If mp_botdebugmode is 1, this will force the bot to come to you. Helps test your nav file.
bot_drawoffmeshconns    Will draw the off-mesh connections present in the loaded navigation file, color-coded based on connection type
bot_drawtempobstacles    Will draw nearby temporary obstacles affecting the nav mesh
```

The bot system uses a modified version of the Detour library from [recastnavigation](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation).

Other bot plugins:
* [RCbot](http://rcbot.bots-united.com/)
* [Whichbot](https://whichbot.sourceforge.net/)
* [Commander AI](https://github.com/jac95501/-NS-Commander-AI)

## Compiling

For Windows, compilation should be working if you have VS2019 installed.

For Linux:

First you need some libraries. On Ubuntu it is:

```sh
apt-get install build-essential git gdb gcc-multilib g++-multilib libc6-dev-i386 mesa-common-dev
``` 

Then you will need to get the files:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ENSL/NS.git
``` 
Then cd to the linux directory:
```sh
cd NS/main/source/linux
```

Then build
```sh
make
```
or `make ns` to build the server binary and `make cl_dll` for the client binary. `make clean` to clean.

If you get this error when running the app: `Fatal Error - could not load library (client.so)`, With a high chance it is because of some `UNDEFINED SYMBOLS` in the shared library. But you can check this with this command:

``` sh 
ldd -r -d client.so
``` 

Make sure you have vgui.so copied to the cl_dll folder too on Linux.

## Debugging
For Windows:
Debug builds can be built with the `Debug` build option. The other debug options are currently broken and are a reference from the original UWE source release. After building the debug version and running it, attach the visual studio debugger to hl.exe.

For Linux:
If you want to debug:
```sh
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" gdb ./hl_linux r -game ns -dev -steam
``` 
Due to the new engine and the nature of Linux a lot of changes were made. You can find them with grep -Ril `@Linux`.

For MacOS & lldb:
```
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=".:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/lldb -- ./hl_osx r -game ns -dev -steam -windowed
```
Have to use XCode's lldb to get around https://stackoverflow.com/a/33589760 (Lack of environment variables). `-windowed` as windowed mode makes it easier to deal with crashes on MacOS.
